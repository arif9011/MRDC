# MRDC
# Overview
#This project looks to implement good practise of data extraction, cleaning and querying to subsequently assist in making business decisions for an example real world environment.

#The goal will be to produce a system that extracts and stores the current company data in a database so that it's accessed from one centralised location and acts as a single source of truth for sales data. 

# Learning Objectives
#To implement data extraction from a range of endpoints utilising AWS RDS databases, PDF conversions, API extractions and S3 buckets containg CSV files.

#To clean the date from each source using pandas and postgresql.

# Project Structure
# Milestone 1 - "Extract and clean the data from the data sources."
